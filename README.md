# otherFigures.R
This file does not depend on the others, and generates all figures except for Figure 3.

# CNDtools.R
This file generates general tools to sample and evaluate the constructed CND. 

# CauchySimulation.R
This file implements the simulation in Example 2 and generates the plots in Figure 3. It uses the methods in CNDtools.R
